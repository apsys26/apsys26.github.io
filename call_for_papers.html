   We take a broad view of computer systems, and solicit papers on topics such as:
  </p>
<ul>

<li>Virtualization</li>
<li>File and storage systems</li>
<li>Networked systems</li>
<li>Mobile, embedded, and IoT systems</li>
<li>Cloud computing and data centers</li>
<li>Edge computing</li>
<li>Big data systems</li>
<li>Distributed systems</li>
<li>Green and sustainable computing</li>
<li>Debugging, testing, verification</li>
<li>Measurement, monitoring, and modeling</li>
<li>Reliability, scalability, and fault tolerance</li>
<li>Security and privacy</li>
<li>Systems for machine learning, machine learning for systems</li>
<li>Hardware and software interaction</li>
<li>Experience with deployed systems</li>
<li>Blockchain and cryptocurrency systems</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submissions">Submissions</h1>
<p>
  Submissions should be five or fewer pages in length excluding references,
  formatted in standard ACM two-column conference style with 10-pt font
  size. Authors should consult the ACM website 
  (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>)
  for the up to date
  template. Reviewing will be double-blind: no author or affiliation information
  should appear in the submission. The authors should additionally follow the
  best practice in order not to disclose their identities implicitly. A
  submission may present preliminary results, propose a new research direction,
  provide insightful retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an
  important systems topic. Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of
  generating insightful technical discussions at the workshop and influencing
  future systems research. Relevant attributes include originality, technical
  merit, clarity, and technical relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the
  proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital
  Library. Consistent with standard scholarly practice, the authors should not
  have substantially similar work in review anywhere else.
